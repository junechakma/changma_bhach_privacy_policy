            <p>Dear Participant,</p>
            <p>We are June Chakma and Md Abrar Hossain, students of Educational Technology and Engineering at Bangladesh Digital University (BDU). As part of our thesis research titled “Enhancing Low Resource Language Acquisition Efficiency with Machine Learning and Motoric-Cognitive Synergy,” we are exploring innovative methods to improve the learning process for low-resource languages using advanced technology and active engagement techniques. We have developed "Changma Bhach," an interactive Chakma language learning app using machine learning and educational theories.</p>
            <p>This survey aims to gather valuable insights to develop more effective and culturally sensitive tools for language acquisition and also how we can improve our app. Additionally, we seek to understand the effectiveness of using digital technologies and tools in facilitating language learning and application. Your responses will play a critical role in advancing our research, and we assure you that all information provided will remain confidential and anonymized, used solely for research purposes.</p>
            <p>Your participation is crucial to the success of this project, and we deeply appreciate your time and valuable input.</p>
            <p>Thank you for supporting our research and development!</p>
            <p>Best regards,<br>June Chakma & Md Abrar Hossain</p>
